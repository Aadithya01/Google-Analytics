# Identifying Potential Customers using Google Analytics data

Project Goal: To help the company focus on marketing channels, optimization of web design and content to increase the number of sign ups.

# Motivation

In a time when organizations are undergoing digital transformations, a good website that sells, makes all the difference. This opens the opportunity to leverage computational algorithms on our web traffic data to gain knowledge on what makes a visitor to hold on to our site and converts him/her into a customer we could serve.

# Data

To illustrate our approach, we partnered with a newly launched tech-driven company who were looking to understand their web visitors and channelize their marketing spend efficiently. Aggregated day-level data scraped from Google Analytics (four-month horizon) and anonymized user-level data (one month)

# Approach

1) Started with data collection. Configured Google Analytics API to scrape data from the Google Analytics platform.
2) Did data Pre-processing and exploratory data analysis. It was important that we get the data to shape required for the project
3) Built ML models (Logistic, Random Forests, XGBoost) to understand driving factors for customer subscription.
4) Compared the performance of summary data vs individual order data and conducted cost-benefit analysis for Google Analytics 360.

# Recommendations

1) Make our website more mobile friendly
2) Make the plan page easy to access with clear information and access to help in case they need more information
3) Create partnerships with referrer A for marketing activities as this channel brings in quality visitors with high probability of becoming our customer.
