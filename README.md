# Google-Analytics

In a time when organizations are undergoing digital transformations, a good website that sells, makes all the difference. This opens the opportunity to leverage computational algorithms on our web traffic data to gain knowledge on what makes a visitor to hold on to our site and converts him/her into a customer we could serve.
To illustrate our approach, we partnered with a newly launched tech-driven company who were looking to understand their web visitors and channelize their marketing spend efficiently.

Project Goal: To help the company focus on marketing channels, optimization of web design and content to increase the number of sign ups.

Data: Aggregated day-level data scraped from Google Analytics (four-month horizon) and anonymized user-level data (one month)

Method: In summary, we trained Logistic regression, Random forest and XGBoost models to derive importance of features that influence conversion (a user who signs up for a plan on the website). At every step, we tried to better the results from the model and aimed for accurate predictions of conversion to be certain of our derived importance of features.
